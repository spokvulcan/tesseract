# Inference-optimization experiments ledger

Endless experiment loop over the Qwen3.5/3.6 PARO models (dense AND MoE) on
the tesseract stack (app + `Vendor/mlx-swift-lm` fork; fork rules in
`docs/mlx-swift-lm-fork.md` — vendor changes shaped upstreamable).

Goal: raw speed/memory only — prefill speed, decode speed, TTFT, CPU
overhead, peak memory — with **zero output-quality loss**. No quantization
changes, no KV-cache quantization, no accuracy-for-speed trades.

## Rules (binding)

- Exactly one hypothesis per iteration; implement minimally.
- Measure Release-only via `scripts/bench.sh` (Debug MLX is ~20× slower).
  Quit the running app first; never two instances. The parity harness runs
  through bench.sh: `scripts/bench.sh quick --model <id> --paro-parity-bench`.
- Quality gate: any change touching numerics or the model graph must pass
  `--paro-parity-bench` (greedy) with **token-identical output** vs the
  unmodified baseline (token IDs recorded per run in the parity report).
- Verdict: reproducible ≥1% win on any metric with no regression on the
  others → commit (Conventional Commits) + log ACCEPTED. Otherwise revert
  completely + log REJECTED. Append either way; commit the ledger with the
  experiment. Tree clean between iterations.

## Measurement discipline (inherited from map #230 — read before trusting any number)

1. **Serialize GPU work** — check `ps` for live `Tesseract Agent` processes
   before trusting a number; a concurrent sweep once fabricated a 562→882
   tok/s "warmup ramp".
2. **Thermals** — the M3 Max throttles under sustained load (602→485 tok/s
   over four back-to-back 32K prefills). A/B must **interleave** (round-robin
   / ABBA) and compare within a round, never all-A-then-all-B. Absolute tok/s
   is not comparable across time.
3. **Launch with `open`, never `nohup`/`&`** from an agent shell — nice 5
   collapses CPU-bound phases (decode 17.7 vs 80.4 tok/s measured).
   `scripts/bench.sh` uses `open -W`; verify `ps -o nice=` → `0`.
4. **Divide timings by FLOPs** before believing kernel comparisons (#251
   retraction).
5. **eval-barrier attribution biases itself** — coarse tier for absolute
   seconds, fine tier only for ratios within a block (#254).
6. **Verify model constants against `config.json`**, never against harness
   assumptions.

## Proven no-gos (never repeat)

| Idea | Verdict | Source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Fused head_dim-256 prefill attention kernel | NO-GO — slower at every context (1.13–1.35×); unfused fallback already at 84–88% of peak bf16 GEMM; the two GEMMs are a hard lower bound | #251 |
| PARO projection fusion (QKV in attention; `in_proj_*` in GDN) | NO-GO, structural — each projection rotates the input with its own `theta`/`channel_scales`; no shared-input GEMM exists | #257, #255 |
| GDN chunk-scan megakernel (MegaGDN-style) | NO-GO — our GDN scan is already a single recurrent Metal kernel, ~1.9 ms/layer/chunk, flat with context | #234 |
| Raising `prefillStepSize` above 1024 | NO-GO — collapses at long context (128K: 155 vs 431 tok/s), peak-memory blowup; balanced chunking (#258) already banked the tail win | #253, #258 |
| `in_proj_b`+`in_proj_a` F16 fusion in GDN | Legal but pointless — ~960 launches saved vs 0.38% CPU graph-construction cost | #255 |
| Cmlx 0.31.1→0.32.0 bump | No measured kernel win (all four hot ops at parity within 4%) | #235 |
| Speculative decoding / draft models | NO-GO — MoE-hostile (~1.11×, ~11% accept), MTP tensors stripped, 248320 vocab locks out drafts | #235 |
| kvBits=8 | Saves zero peak memory, costs decode 7.6→40%; dropped as default | #252 |
| `gather_qmm` gather/scatter overhead theory | Killed — permutation+rotations are 3.17 s vs 25.54 s matmuls at 32K/step-1024 | #254 |

## Open questions from prior art

- **#256 `gather_qmm` rows-per-expert headroom** — unresolved: 43.2% of peak
  at B/E=32 → 64.4% at B/E=128. Bandwidth roofline (unrecoverable) or tiling
  (recoverable, ~14% of prefill)? Needs a TFLOP/s-vs-B/E sweep at fixed total
  FLOPs. The grouped-sorted fast path (`gather_qmm_rhs`) is **already
  engaged** in prefill — no "small-M fallback" to escape.
- Decode-side beyond kvBits: sampler/per-step Swift overhead — un-sized.
- Load-time: PARO 35B cold load ~40.8 s (AWQ→MLX conversion); Prepared
  Checkpoint artifact exists in the fork — check app wiring.
- Warm-path TTFT (prefix-cache restore cost).

## Environment

- Hardware: Mac15,9 (M3 Max), 48 GB
- Target models: `qwen3.5-4b-paro` (dense, z-lab/Qwen3.5-4B-PARO),
  `qwen3.6-35b-a3b-paro` (MoE, z-lab/Qwen3.6-35B-A3B-PARO)
- Ruler: `--paro-parity-bench` (greedy, fp16 KV, 256 new tokens, contexts
  128/8192/32768, 2 runs/context, production `prefillStepSize=1024`,
  balanced chunking active) — reports prefill tok/s, decode tok/s, peak GB,
  load s, tokenize s per context, and per-run generated token IDs.

## Session 2026-07-23

Git HEAD at session start: `5d955f46` (chore(vendor): re-pin mlx-swift-lm on
upstream eaefe75). Harness change preceding all experiments this session
(non-numeric): parity bench records per-run token IDs; app dispatch routes
`--paro-parity-bench` before `--benchmark` so bench.sh can drive it.

### Baseline (fresh, this session)

Recorded 2026-07-23 ~02:20 local, Release build @ `5d955f46` + non-numeric
harness change, quiet machine, nice 0 verified. Reports:
`benchmarks/results/paro-parity/baseline_*.json` (per-run token IDs included).

**qwen3.5-4b-paro** (load 1.4 s):

| ctx | prefill tok/s (r0/r1) | decode tok/s (r0/r1) | peak GB |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 128 | 914.1 / 915.9 | 108.3 / 108.2 | 2.82 |
| 8192 | 1354.4 / 1349.9 | 95.5 / 95.0 | 4.18 |
| 32768 | 967.3 / 1001.0 | 57.1 / 57.3 | 5.67 |

**qwen3.6-35b-a3b-paro** (load 4.8 s — Prepared Checkpoint active; #230's
40.8 s cold load is stale, load-time is no longer a target):

| ctx | prefill tok/s (r0/r1) | decode tok/s (r0/r1) | peak GB |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 128 | 741.4 / 747.1 | 79.8 / 80.7 | 19.07 |
| 8192 | 1457.5 / 1457.5 | 75.6 / 76.4 | 20.27 |
| 32768 | 1005.7 / 1158.4 | 60.8 / 65.2 | 21.44 |

Notes: MoE 32K shows ~15% run-to-run prefill variance (thermal — trap 2);
all A/B verdicts must interleave against the baseline binary, not against
this table. Decode falls steeply with context on the dense model
(108→57 t/s) — per-step overhead scales with KV length.
