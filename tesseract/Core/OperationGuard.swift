//
//  The **Operation Guard** — the single home for the monotonic-epoch *stale-result*
//  protocol shared by the capture→transcribe→commit coordinators (today
//  `DictationCoordinator` and **Voice Input** / `AgentVoiceInputController`). It exists
//  because the underlying recognizer may *ignore `Task` cancellation and return success
//  anyway*, so cancelling the task cannot stop a stale transcription from committing —
//  only a post-`await` epoch comparison can.
//
//  Usage contract (the *why* behind each step lives in CONTEXT.md → "Operation staleness"):
//
//    - `invalidate()` advances the epoch — called at `cancel()` and at *operation start*;
//    - `capture()` snapshots the epoch into an `OperationTicket` at the entry of async work;
//    - `ticket.isCurrent` is read after **every** `await` resume to gate the commit.
//
//  It owns **only** the epoch protocol; `Task` cancellation and the audio/transcription
//  teardown stay caller-side. No `Sendable`: the guard is a stored property of an
//  `@MainActor` coordinator and every ticket is captured inside a coordinator-owned
//  non-detached `Task`, so the guard outlives every ticket it vends.
//

/// Owns one monotonic `epoch` counter and vends inert `OperationTicket` snapshots of it.
/// See the file header and CONTEXT.md → "Operation staleness".
